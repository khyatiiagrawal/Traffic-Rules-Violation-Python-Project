# Traffic-Rules-Violation-Python-Project
All violations are noted by a traffic policeman in a file as a record &lt;license number of driver, fine amount>. At the end of each day, files from all traffic policemen are collated. If a driver had been charged with greater than five violations, then he has to be booked for further legal action. Also, the police department wants to take strict action on policemen who are not performing their duties. All policemen will have to book at least 10 violators in a given period to avoid further action.
